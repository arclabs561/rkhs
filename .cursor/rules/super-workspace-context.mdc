## Invariant: repo path is truth

This workspace is a super-workspace containing many independent repos.

- Treat `open_and_recently_viewed_files` as a UI hint only.
- Never assume the currently open file indicates the repo/task being worked on.

## Practical workflow

- When a task is repo-scoped, first name the repo directory explicitly (e.g. `anno/`, `cerno/`, `wass/`, `devdev/tooling/dev-top/`).
- Prefer pinning the repo root with `@Folders` before making multi-file changes.
- Scope searches to the chosen repo directory (avoid whole-workspace scans unless explicitly needed).

## Drift check (cheap)

If the only open file(s) are outside the named repo, call that out and ask to pin the correct folder/file(s) before proceeding.
